  STR_BREEDING_UFOP: " Commander!{NEWLINE} Considering the friendliness of some of those specimens we captured with humans, it is expected that we can, perhaps, keep them as domestic animals ourselves and, with such intents in mind, the idea of breeding those animals doesn’t seem so illogical.

  STR_BREEDING_RAT: "Rat breeding"
  STR_BREEDING_RAT_UFOP: " After careful examination and cataloguing of the reproductive behaviours of the giant rat we are now able to induce reproduction.
